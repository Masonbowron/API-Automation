 Sprint 7 project

  This projects goals was to complete a total of eight tests; two tests each for the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE HTTP requests using JavaScript. 

The way this project was completed was by using postman to get the correct status code and JSON body results for each test. /Swagger was used for finding the corret endpoints for each intended test. Visual Studio Code was used for code input and connnected terminal was used to see the outcome of the code written. 

To run the tests open up the terminal associated with Visual Stuido code and call npx jest "file where code was saved". If code was written correct it will result in green PASS, check marks next to name of test.
